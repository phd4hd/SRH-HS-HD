# Some hints

Please try to solve the exercise before reading these tips.

- You need to expand the backend. This will be a DELETE request on some resource. Maybe /api/v1/reviews/{id}
- This could happen in the ReviewController with updating the database.
- You need to expand the frontend. In der Reviews component when we iterate through the books.reviewIds
- This could be a simple Button with an onClick handler
- In this handler a call to the extension of the backend must be called
- After that the reviewIds array could be reduced by one item

## Happy coding!
